Prevent Object Mutation:    Object.freeze 
Object.freeze(obj);


### Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions:
  ```js
  const myFunc = () => {
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
  }
  ```

### Write Arrow Functions with Parameters:
  ```js
  const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
  multiplier(4, 2);
  ```

### Set Default Parameters for Your Functions:
  ```js
const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;
  console.log(greeting("John"));
  console.log(greeting());
The console will display the strings Hello John and Hello Anonymous.


### Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters:
With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.
  ```js
  function howMany(a,b,...args) {
      return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
  }
  console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
  ```
would return 1, 2 [3, 4, 5]


### Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place:
Returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array.
  ```js
  const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
  const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
  ```
maximus would have a value of 89.


### Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects:
  ```js
  const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
  const name = user.name;
  ```
would create a const name = 'John Doe';
  

### Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects:
  ```js
  const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
  const { name: userName } = user;
  ```
would create a const userName = 'John Doe';


### Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects:
  ```js
  const user = {
      johnDoe: { 
        age: 34,
        email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
      }
    };
    const { johnDoe: { age: userAge}} = user;.
  ```
would create a const userAge = 34;


### Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays:
One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list.
Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:
  ```js
  const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  console.log(a, b);
    ```
The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.
We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:
  ```js
  const [a, b, , , c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  console.log(a, b, c);
  ```
The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.


### Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements:
In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.
  ```js
  const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
  console.log(a, b);
  console.log(arr);
  ```
The console would display the values 1, 2 and [3, 4, 5, 7].


### Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters:
In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.
  ```js
  const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
      const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  }
  ```
This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:
  ```js
  const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {           }
  example from pracitice:
  const stats = {
      max: 56.78,
      average: 35.85,
      min: -0.75
  };
const half = ({max, min}) => (max + min) / 2.0; 
  ```


### Create Strings using Template Literals:
Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.
  ```js
  const person = {
      name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
      age: 56
    };
  ```
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}! I am ${person.age} years old.`;
The console will display the strings Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro! and I am 56 years old..

### Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand:
ES6 adds some nice support for easily defining object literals. Consider the following code:
  ```js
  const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
      x: x,
      y: y
  });
  ```
ES6 provides the syntactic sugar to eliminate the redundancy of having to write x: x.  
You can simply write x once, and it will be converted tox: x (or something equivalent) under the hood. 
  ```js
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
  ```

### Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6:
When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword function as follows:
  ```js
  const person = {
      name: "Taylor",
      sayHello: function() {
        return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
      }
  };
  With ES6, you can remove the function keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:
    ```js
  const person = {
      name: "Taylor",
      sayHello() {
          return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
      }
  };
  ```

### Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function:
        && It should be noted that the class syntax is just syntax, and not a full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented paradigm, unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

In ES5, we usually define a constructor function and use the new keyword to instantiate an object:
  ```js
  var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
      this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
  var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
  The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:
    ```js
  class SpaceShuttle {
      constructor(targetPlanet) {
        this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
      }
  }
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
  ```
Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in SpaceShuttle used above.


### Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object:
  ```js
  class Book {
      constructor(author) {
        this._author = author;
      }
      // getter
      get writer() {
        return this._author;
      }
      // setter
      set writer(updatedAuthor) {
        this._author = updatedAuthor;
      }
  }
  ```
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
The console would display the strings anonymous
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);
The console would display the strings and newAuthor.
Notice the syntax used to invoke the getter and setter.
They do not even look like functions. Getters and setters are important because they hide internal implementation details.
Note: It is convention to precede the name of a private variable with an underscore (_). However, the practice itself does not make a variable private.


### Create a Module Script:
 In order to make JavaScript more modular, clean, and maintainable; ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of module. Here’s an example:
   ```js
 <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
   ```
 A script that uses this module type can now use the import and export features you will learn about in the upcoming challenges.


### Use export to Share a Code Block:
magine a file called math_functions.js that contains several functions related to mathematical operations. One of them is stored in a variable, add, that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. You want to use this function in several different JavaScript files. In order to share it with these other files, you first need to export it.
  ```js
  export const add = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
  }
The above is a common way to export a single function, but you can achieve the same thing like this:
  const add = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
  }
  export { add };
  ```
When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use it without having to rewrite the code. You can export multiple things by repeating the first example for each thing you want to export, or by placing them all in the export statement of the second example, like this:
  export { add, subtract };


### Reuse JavaScript Code Using import:
  import { add } from './math_functions.js';
Here, import will find add in math_functions.js, import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest. 
You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the import statement like this:
  import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';


### Use * to Import Everything from a File:
Suppose you have a file and you wish to import all of its contents into the current file. This can be done with the import * as syntax.
  import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
The above import statement will create an object called myMathModule. This is just a variable name, you can name it anything. The object will contain all of the exports from math_functions.js in it, so you can access the functions like you would any other object property. Here's how you can use the add and subtract functions that were imported:
  ```js
  myMathModule.add(2,3);
  myMathModule.subtract(5,3);
  ```


### Create an Export Fallback with export default:
There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. 
Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.
  ```js
  export default function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  export default function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  ```
Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const


### Import a Default Export:
To import a default export, you need to use a different import syntax. 
In the following example, add is the default export of the math_functions.js file. Here is how to import it:
  ```js
  import add from "./math_functions.js";
  ```
The syntax differs in one key place. The imported value, add, is not surrounded by curly braces ({}). add here is simply a variable name for whatever the default export of the math_functions.js file is. You can use any name here when importing a default.


### Create a JavaScript Promise:
A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so. Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise. 
  ```js
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  });
  ```

### Complete a Promise with resolve and reject:
A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. The promise you created in the last challenge is forever stuck in the pending state because you did not add a way to complete the promise. The resolve and reject parameters given to the promise argument are used to do this.
  ```js
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(condition here) {
      resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
    } else {
      reject("Promise was rejected");
    }
  });
  ```

### Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then:
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Here’s an example:
  ```js
  myPromise.then(result => {
  });
  ```
result comes from the argument given to the resolve method.

### Handle a Rejected Promise with catch:
catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called. Here’s the syntax:
  ```js
  myPromise.catch(error => {
  });
  ```
error is the argument passed in to the reject method.
